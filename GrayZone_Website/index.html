                        <p data-key="game-description">The player takes on the role of a high school senior on the path
                            to education, where he will
                            continue his studies and higher education. He receives a wonderful opportunity for a
                            scholarship to a great university abroad, but the time to apply for the scholarship is
                            short.
                            To succeed, the player must go through a series of series and situations that look at
                            reality - preparing documents, administrative, interviews with institutions and test 
                            questions. <br><br>At each step, the player is faced with a choice: to follow the honest
                            path and put in the effort, or to choose which groups of positive practices at first glance
                            seem like a solution.
                            The decisions they make lead the player through a ‘gray zone’ - a space in which the border
                            between ethically correct actions and illegal actions is unclear and difficult to demarcate.
                            <br><br>Each choice has consequences based on the story and the final outcome: obtaining
                            the scholarship in an honest way, dismiss opportunity, or achieve success through a group of
                            practices
                            that leave behind negative integrity scars.<br><br>
                            The game offers multiple scenarios and endings that make it playful and interactive, and the
                            response to critical thinking for young people about the importance of integrity, ethical
                            choices and the consequences of corruption.

                            The goals of the game that we strive to achieve are the following: <br><br>
                            Young people are faced with real corrupt situations.
                            Of course, critical thinking, moral assessment and active reflection on the decisions made
                            by each player. (In the process of playing, each player's integrity, reputation, time and
                            money are measured). <br>
                            Values ​​such as integrity, honesty and resistance to corruption are promoted.
                            <br>A long-lasting resource which will be used in teaching and non-formal educational
                            environments.
